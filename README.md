## Description

The CityFactory project is a top-down game that serves both as a game and a training project for the "Factory" design pattern. Players interact with the environment by clicking on empty territories to create cities. These cities, in turn, produce factories for peaceful or military purposes, generating goods such as consumable materials or transport at regular intervals.
